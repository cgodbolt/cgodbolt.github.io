            <h2>Activities We Offer</h2>
            <p>Our carefully planned program allows children to choose from a wide range of play and learning experiences and in doing so, help them recognize, understand and express their own emotions as well as to sympathize and respect emotions of others.</p>
            <p>The variety of experiences include opportunities for creative self-expression through media such as dance, musical rhythm and art; development of manipulative skills and motor coordination through puzzles, blocks, bikes and climbing equipment; the increase of knowledge through excursions, cooking and science activities; the development of concepts through exposure to materials which stimulate basic awareness; the growth of language skills through stories, song and dramatic play.</p>
            <h3>Classrooms:</h3>
            <p>Each of the classrooms at Kids Academy is set up with learning centers. These centers include Reading, Literacy and Language, Manipulatives, Discovery, Imaginative Play, Blocks, Creative Expression, and Music. The possibilities for learning are endless in these centers, as they are filled with age-appropriate toys, games, and activities to facilitate learning.</p>
