            <h2>Activities We Offer</h2>
            <p>Our carefully planned program allows children to choose from a wide range of play and learning experiences and in doing so, help them recognize, understand and express their own emotions as well as to sympathize and respect emotions of others.</p>
            <p>The variety of experiences include opportunities for creative self-expression through media such as dance, musical rhythm, and art; development of manipulative skills and motor coordination through puzzles, blocks, bikes, and climbing equipment; the increase of knowledge through excursions, cooking, and science activities; the development of concepts through exposure to materials which stimulate basic awareness; the growth of language skills through stories, song, and dramatic play.</p>
